See below to see the comparison between ECS and OOP implementation performance.

# Note:
Unfortunately, my ECS implementation of the Apple Picker game does not work. Despite my best efforts, I could not figure out how to convert my game over to ECS. Behind the scenes, there is quite a bit of structure set up - I had difficulty instantiating/spawning objects, although I am not sure why since I was following the tutorials provided by the professor. Additionally, there are several files (scripts mostly) left in the Assets directory as they were there for reference and I did not remove them (since I did not finish converting to ECS).
